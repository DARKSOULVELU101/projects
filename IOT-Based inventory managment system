	Like,
•	Human errors in manual data entry.
•	Delayed updates causing stock discrepancies.
•	Inefficient logistics due to lack of real-time visibility.
•	Overstocking/understocking from poor demand forecasting.
	Case Study:

4. PROPOSED SYSTEM
	The proposed IoT-based system employs RFID sensors, weight sensors, and microcontrollers to monitor stock in a warehouse. 
	Items are tagged with RFID chips,
and shelf-mounted sensors detect the presence and quantity of goods. 
	The data collected is sent to a cloud server via a microcontroller, enabling real-time tracking and remote monitoring through a dashboard.
	Alerts are generated when stock reaches reorder levels, thus automating inventory control and reducing human intervention.
	The system includes:
•	IoT Sensors: RFID tags, barcode scanners, and weight sensors for real-time tracking.
•	Microcontroller/PLC: Processes sensor data and triggers alerts.
•	Cloud Platform: Stores inventory data and enables remote access.
•	Mobile/Web Dashboard: Displays stock levels, analytics, and alerts.
•	AI Analytics: Predicts demand and optimizes restocking.



	Features:
✔ Automated stock alerts
✔ Predictive restocking
✔ Remote access

(Not applicable in IoT systems using microcontrollers; however, control flow logic is defined in code. A pseudocode or flowchart could be substituted.)

 

 
 
9. WORKING:
	When an item is placed or removed from a shelf, the corresponding sensor detects the change in weight or RFID presence.
	 The microcontroller processes this data and updates the cloud database.
